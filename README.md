Course Number: CPSC-350-02\
Assignment Number: 7\

Sources: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/quick-sort/, https://www.codeproject.com/Questions/676477/Generate-Random-Double-Number\ https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shellsort/\
Instructions: make all + ./assignment7.out create 10 input.txt or ./assignment7.out sort input.txt\
Additional Notes: When generating doubles from range (0,500,000], it would make it so that only some of the values have decimals and some of them do not. However, when I use a range such as range(0, 1.5], it will create all decimal values. Nonetheless, all the values are still doubles and the code runs with no issue.
